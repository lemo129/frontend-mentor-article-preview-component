This project is a fully interactive article preview where users can share said article via Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest, toggle between light and dark mode, and experience a responsive, accessible design across all screen sizes.

Created as part of the building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

---

## 🔍 Overview

The component is built with **semantic HTML5**, **modern CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript modules** to handle dynamic behavior.

The main focus was creating an accessible and mobile-first layout with theme toggling and working social share links while also respecting user preferences.

---

## ✨ Features

- Responsive layout (mobile-first, scales up to desktop).
- Light/dark theme toggle
- Share to **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and **Pinterest** with pre-filled content
- Made sure site still works in `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Accessible interactive elements which uses ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, `aria-hidden`)
- Added a simple keyboard support (`Escape` key closes share links if opened)
- Pixel-perfect implementation with [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonecod/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- I learned how to utlize more ARIA attributes in HTML5 for better accessibility
- First time learning that I can't normally target `::after` elements with JavaScript
- Using `matchMedia` for **reduced motion** checks
- Gained more experience in managing component state with ARIA attributes
- Getting more comfortable in writing modular JavaScript (`import/export`) for cleaner code separation.
- How to generate social share links dynamically for multiple platforms using `encodeURIComponent()` in JavaScript.
